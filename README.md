# Lab 2: Geo-tagged tweet collection and visualization

In this lab, I collected geo-tagged Twitter data with Twitter API. I searched for the tweets that related to the keyword 'quarantine' with ` stream.filter(track=['quarantine'])` for 360 seconds.

The image below shows the locations of tweets related to 'quarantine'. There are two areas that have a high density of dots, California and the east coast of the U.S. From this result, we could tell these areas have a higher population. Lots of people need to stay home to stop the spread of COVID 19 in the U.S. Moreover, because of the quarantine, people use twitter to share their feelings and thought about the quarantine.
